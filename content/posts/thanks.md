Mark - It has been great working with you!

<!--more-->

As a parting gift (really - so long for now), I registered the domain: **thwaites.dev**, which is where you are reading this post right now!

The domain is paid for a year. If you want to renew it, I will transfer it over to you.

Also, I setup this super easy to maintain blog using a static site generator called Hugo. I'd love to spend an hour and show you how to use it.

Love,

Micah
